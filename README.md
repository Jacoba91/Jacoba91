# Jacob Aragao

I am a Software Engineering student at McGill University (Class of 2027) and the Co-Founder of VentureCircle. My work focuses on building scalable full-stack applications and integrating machine learning into consumer-facing products.

I have production experience with React, Node.js, and TypeScript through internships at CareHive Health and Clearer.io. Recently, I have been building real-time multimodal AI agents and developing the platform infrastructure for VentureCircle.
